libxkbcommon (0.1.0~1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Fix short description for libxkbcommon-dev.

  [ Timo Aaltonen ]
  * Merge master up to c19661b965.

 -- Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Feb 2012 22:12:02 +0100

libxkbcommon (0.1.0~0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #611401):
    - Merge master up to b9b0011994.
  * Since there's no upstream release yet, use 0.1.0~X-Y as version
    numbers, with:
    - 0.1.0: the version currently in configure.ac;
    - X: an integer bumped everytime we create a snapshot;
    - Y: Debian revision.
  * Keep shlibs very strict: packages linking against libxkbcommon will
    pick a dependency on the particular revision they were linked
    against. Since users are likely to be only XServer and Wayland, that
    shouldn't be too much of a hassle. (All of them will probably stay in
    experimental for a while anyway, libxkbcommon support isn't merged in
    XServer's master yet.)
  * Write a “tarball” target to generate upstream tarballs for next
    snapshots.
  * Use xkb-data build-dep since it's needed for the test suite.
